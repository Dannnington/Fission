# Fission

The front-end web component for Nexus, originally built for [MineRIP](https://mine.rip). It is written in JavaScript, built on top of the React.js framework.

Fission is part of the Nexus project, an announcement system and website framework built on top of the React and Fastify frameworks. This repository makes up the user-facing side of Nexus, with the other half, Fusion, being the developer- and backend-facing engine of the system. In the future, Fusion will be released publicly under the GNU General Public License version 3.0, and both will be available as part of Nexus.
